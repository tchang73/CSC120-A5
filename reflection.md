- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impressions of associations is that it makes it easier to start working on the project since it is individual small components of the entire thing, so it is less daunting than trying to get the whole thing in one go. In the end when putting everything together, it made sense why and how we call each part of the scarecrow. The command line input was confusing to get, so Tseegi and I went to TA hours, which was helpful in the end but both the TA and us could not figure out how to do it for half an hour. I would advise future students to work with someone and seek help when needed.
